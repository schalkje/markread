Version change: TODO(CONSTITUTION_VERSION):unknown -> 1.0.0

Modified principles:
- PRINCIPLE_1_NAME -> I. Code Quality (simplified for solo development)
- PRINCIPLE_2_NAME -> II. User Experience Consistency (Windows app focused)
- PRINCIPLE_3_NAME -> III. Documentation Standard (minimal but useful)
- PRINCIPLE_4_NAME -> IV. Performance Requirements (desktop app focused)

Added sections:
- Development Guidelines (simplified)

Removed sections:
- Formal testing gates and review processes (solo project)
- Complex governance structures

Templates reviewed:
- .specify/templates/plan-template.md ✅ reviewed — may need simplification for solo use
- .specify/templates/spec-template.md ✅ reviewed — may need simplification for solo use  
- .specify/templates/tasks-template.md ✅ reviewed — may need simplification for solo use
- .specify/templates/commands/* ⚠ pending — commands directory not found; manual review required

Follow-up TODOs:
- Consider simplifying templates for single-developer workflow

# MarkRead Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality

Code SHOULD be maintainable and well-structured. Guidelines:

- Write clean, readable code with meaningful names and clear logic flow.
- Add tests for critical functionality when it makes sense (not everything needs full coverage).
- Use linting/formatting tools when available to maintain consistency.
- Document complex decisions or algorithms inline.

Rationale: Clean code is easier to debug and extend over time.

### II. User Experience Consistency

The application SHOULD behave consistently for the user. Guidelines:

- Error messages SHOULD be clear and helpful (not just "Error occurred").
- UI patterns and terminology SHOULD be consistent throughout the application.
- Settings and preferences SHOULD be easy to find and understand.

Rationale: Consistent behavior makes the application more pleasant to use.

### III. Documentation Standard

Document what matters. Guidelines:

- Include a README that explains what the application does and how to run it.
- Document non-obvious design decisions when they might be confusing later.
- Keep documentation simple and up-to-date rather than comprehensive but stale.

Rationale: Good documentation helps you remember why you made certain choices.


### IV. Performance Requirements

Keep performance reasonable for a Windows desktop application. Guidelines:

- Application SHOULD start up reasonably quickly (under 5 seconds).
- UI SHOULD be responsive during normal use (no long freezes).
- Memory usage SHOULD be reasonable for typical use cases.
- Profile performance when adding heavy operations (file processing, network calls).

Rationale: A responsive application provides a better user experience.

## Development Guidelines

- Keep things simple: Don't over-engineer solutions.
- Focus on features that matter: Build what you actually need.
- Test important functionality: Not everything needs tests, but core features should work reliably.
- Document decisions: Write down why you chose certain approaches when it's not obvious.

## Governance

This document serves as a personal reference for development standards.

- Version changes: Update this document when development practices change significantly.
- Keep it simple: This is a guideline, not a bureaucracy.
