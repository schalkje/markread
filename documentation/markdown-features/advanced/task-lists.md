## Note About Interactivity

In MarkRead, task lists are **read-only** (viewer mode). Checkboxes display status but cannot be toggled.

To update task lists:
1. Open file in your editor
2. Change `[ ]` to `[x]` or vice versa
3. Save file
4. MarkRead auto-reloads (if enabled)

## Best Practices

‚úÖ Use for tracking progress
‚úÖ Group related tasks
‚úÖ Be specific with task descriptions
‚úÖ Keep lists manageable (< 20 items)

‚ùå Don't use for regular lists
‚ùå Don't nest more than 3 levels
‚ùå Don't mix task and regular lists
