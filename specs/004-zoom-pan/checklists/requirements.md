# Specification Quality Checklist: Zoom and Pan Controls

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-21
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

All checklist items have been validated and passed. The specification is complete and ready for the next phase.

### Details:

- **Content Quality**: The spec focuses entirely on user needs and behavior without mentioning specific technologies like WebView2, WPF, or JavaScript APIs.

- **Requirements**: All 17 functional requirements are clear, testable, and unambiguous. No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were needed because:
  - Zoom increments follow standard application patterns (don't need to specify exact percentages)
  - Pan behavior follows standard conventions (drag to pan)
  - Default zoom of 100% is industry standard
  - Session-only persistence is reasonable default (not persisting to disk is simpler and addresses common use case)

- **Success Criteria**: All 8 success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic:
  - Time-based metrics (5 seconds, 2 seconds, 1 second, 10 seconds, 2 minutes)
  - Percentage metrics (95% discoverability)
  - Qualitative metrics (no visual lag, no viewport jumps)

- **User Scenarios**: 7 prioritized user stories with clear acceptance criteria, covering complete user journey from basic zoom to advanced features

- **Edge Cases**: 7 edge cases identified covering boundaries, interactions, and state management

## Notes

The specification is production-ready and can proceed to `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan` without modifications.
