# Tasks: Mockup UI Implementation

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-mockup-ui/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Integration and unit tests are included to validate UI behavior and theme functionality.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

Based on WPF desktop application structure from plan.md:
- **Main source**: `src/` at repository root
- **Tests**: `tests/` with unit/ and integration/ subdirectories
- **Assets**: `src/Rendering/assets/` for CSS, JavaScript, and icons

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-8)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can proceed in parallel (if staffed) since they focus on different UI areas
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1) - Visual Interface**: Can start after Foundational - Foundation for all other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1) - Theme System**: Can start after Foundational - Independent from US1 but enhances it
- **User Story 3 (P2) - Navigation**: Can start after Foundational - Independent but integrates with theme system
- **User Story 4 (P2) - Tabs**: Can start after Foundational - Independent but benefits from theme system
- **User Story 5 (P3) - Sidebar**: Can start after Foundational - Independent but integrates with responsive design
- **User Story 6 (P3) - Search**: Can start after Foundational - Independent but benefits from theme system

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models/interfaces before services
- Services before UI components
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, multiple user stories can start in parallel
- Tests within each story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models and interfaces within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create visual mockup comparison test in tests/integration/VisualDesignTests.cs"
Task: "Create responsive layout test in tests/integration/ResponsiveLayoutTests.cs"

# Launch theme definitions in parallel:
Task: "Create light theme color scheme definition in src/App/Themes/LightTheme.xaml"
Task: "Create dark theme color scheme definition in src/App/Themes/DarkTheme.xaml"
Task: "Implement base CSS styling for markdown content in src/Rendering/assets/styles/markdown-base.css"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 & 2 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Visual Interface)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (Theme System)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test visual design and theme switching independently
6. Deploy/demo if ready - this provides immediate visual transformation

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Basic visual improvement
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Full theme system (MVP!)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Enhanced navigation
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Professional tabs
6. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Enhanced sidebar
7. Add User Story 6 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Complete UI overhaul
8. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Visual Interface) + User Story 2 (Theme System)
   - Developer B: User Story 3 (Navigation) + User Story 4 (Tabs)
   - Developer C: User Story 5 (Sidebar) + User Story 6 (Search)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Focus on mockup visual accuracy throughout implementation
- Maintain <100ms theme switching performance target
- Ensure 60fps animation performance across all interactions
