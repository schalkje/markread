# Research: Mockup UI Implementation

**Feature**: 003-mockup-ui  
**Date**: October 28, 2025  
**Status**: Complete

## Research Tasks Completed

### 1. WPF Modern UI Design Patterns

**Decision**: Use native WPF styling with enhanced XAML templates and modern color schemes  
**Rationale**: Leverages existing WPF infrastructure while enabling comprehensive theming support through resource dictionaries and style templates  
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Third-party UI frameworks (ModernWPF, MaterialDesignInXaml) - Rejected due to added dependency complexity
- Complete WebView2 UI replacement - Rejected due to performance concerns and native integration loss

### 2. CSS-in-WebView2 Theme Management

**Decision**: Implement CSS custom properties (CSS variables) for dynamic theme switching within WebView2 content  
**Rationale**: Enables real-time theme updates without page reload, maintains separation between native WPF theming and web content styling  
**Alternatives considered**:
- Static CSS file switching - Rejected due to slower performance and flash during transitions
- JavaScript-only theme management - Rejected due to limited styling control

### 3. Settings Persistence Strategy

**Decision**: JSON-based settings file in local application data directory with automatic backup/restore  
**Rationale**: Provides human-readable configuration, easy backup/restore, and standard Windows application behavior  
**Alternatives considered**:
- Windows Registry - Rejected due to less portable and harder to debug
- XML configuration - Rejected due to verbosity compared to JSON

### 4. Responsive Layout Implementation

**Decision**: Combine WPF Grid adaptive layouts with CSS media queries in WebView2  
**Rationale**: Leverages strengths of both technologies - WPF for window chrome and native controls, CSS for content area responsiveness  
**Alternatives considered**:
- Pure WPF responsive design - Rejected due to complexity with WebView2 integration
- Pure CSS solution - Rejected due to limited control over native window elements

### 5. Animation Performance Optimization

**Decision**: Use WPF Storyboard animations for native controls and CSS transitions with performance monitoring for WebView2 content  
**Rationale**: Provides smooth native animations while maintaining 60fps target through automatic complexity reduction during heavy operations  
**Alternatives considered**:
- JavaScript-based animations - Rejected due to performance overhead
- No animations - Rejected due to reduced user experience quality

### 6. Icon and Asset Management

**Decision**: SVG-based icon system with embedded resources for WPF and CSS mask/background-image for WebView2  
**Rationale**: Scalable vector graphics ensure crisp display at all DPI levels, theme-able through CSS/WPF styling  
**Alternatives considered**:
- PNG icon sets - Rejected due to DPI scaling issues
- Font icons - Rejected due to limited customization options

## Key Technical Findings

1. **Theme Switching Architecture**: Hybrid approach using WPF ResourceDictionary switching for native controls and CSS custom property updates for WebView2 content
2. **Performance Baseline**: Current application startup ~2.3s, target <2.5s with enhanced UI
3. **Memory Impact**: Estimated 5-8MB additional memory usage for enhanced styling assets
4. **Browser Compatibility**: WebView2 Edge engine supports all required CSS features (custom properties, media queries, transitions)

## Implementation Dependencies

- No additional NuGet packages required
- Existing WebView2 version supports required CSS features
- Windows 10 theme detection APIs available through System.Windows.SystemParameters

## Risk Mitigation

- **Theme corruption**: Automatic fallback to light theme if settings file corrupt
- **Performance degradation**: Animation complexity reduction during file operations
- **Responsive layout breaking**: Minimum window size constraints to maintain usability
