## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Modern Visual Interface (Priority: P1)

Users experience a clean, professional markdown viewer interface that matches the Figma mockup design with proper spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy.

**Why this priority**: The visual design is the foundation that provides immediate user value and professional appearance, making the application visually appealing and easy to use.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by launching the application and comparing visual elements (layout, colors, fonts, spacing) against the mockup reference, delivering immediate visual improvement.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the application is launched, **When** a user views the interface, **Then** the layout matches the mockup with proper header, sidebar, content area, and tab structure
2. **Given** the interface is displayed, **When** a user examines visual elements, **Then** colors, fonts, spacing, and component styling match the professional mockup design
3. **Given** the application is running, **When** a user resizes the window, **Then** the interface remains visually consistent and responsive

### User Story 2 - Light/Dark Theme System (Priority: P1)

Users can seamlessly switch between light and dark themes with proper color schemes, icons, and visual feedback to match their preference or system settings.

**Why this priority**: Theme support is essential for user comfort and accessibility, allowing users to work in their preferred visual environment.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by toggling the theme button and verifying all interface elements properly switch between light and dark color schemes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the application is running, **When** a user clicks the theme toggle button, **Then** the interface switches between light and dark modes instantly
2. **Given** a theme is selected, **When** a user interacts with any interface element, **Then** all colors, backgrounds, borders, and text remain consistent with the chosen theme
3. **Given** the application is restarted, **When** it loads, **Then** the previously selected theme is remembered and applied

### User Story 3 - Enhanced Navigation Experience (Priority: P2)

Users navigate through the interface using an improved header with unified controls for navigation (back/forward), file management, search, and export functions.

**Why this priority**: Unified navigation significantly improves user workflow and efficiency by consolidating key actions in an accessible location.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by using navigation controls, search buttons, and export options to verify they are properly positioned and functional in the header.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a file is open, **When** a user clicks the back/forward buttons, **Then** navigation through file history works smoothly with proper button states
2. **Given** the application is running, **When** a user accesses search or export functions from the header, **Then** the corresponding features open correctly
3. **Given** multiple files are open, **When** a user views the header, **Then** the current file path is clearly displayed in the center area

---

### User Story 4 - Professional Tab Interface (Priority: P2)

Users work with multiple files using an enhanced tab system that includes scrollable tabs, close buttons, visual active indicators, and smooth interactions.

**Why this priority**: Improved tab management enhances productivity when working with multiple markdown files simultaneously.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by opening multiple files and verifying tab scrolling, closing, and selection behaviors work according to the mockup design.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple files are open, **When** tabs exceed the available width, **Then** horizontal scrolling controls appear and function properly
2. **Given** tabs are displayed, **When** a user hovers over a tab, **Then** the close button becomes visible with smooth animation
3. **Given** a tab is active, **When** a user views the tab bar, **Then** the active tab is clearly distinguished with proper visual indicators

---

### User Story 5 - Enhanced File Tree Sidebar (Priority: P3)

Users browse and navigate files using an improved sidebar with better visual hierarchy, icons, and collapsible folder structure matching the mockup design.

**Why this priority**: An enhanced file tree improves file discovery and navigation, though it builds upon existing functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by using the sidebar to browse folders and select files, verifying visual improvements and interaction behaviors.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the sidebar is visible, **When** a user views the file tree, **Then** folders and files are displayed with appropriate icons and indentation
2. **Given** a file is selected in the sidebar, **When** a user views the tree, **Then** the selected file is highlighted with proper visual feedback
3. **Given** the sidebar is displayed, **When** a user toggles folder expansion, **Then** smooth animations and proper state management occur

---

### User Story 6 - Search Interface Improvements (Priority: P3)

Users access enhanced search functionality with improved visual design for both in-page search and global file search features.

**Why this priority**: Search interface improvements enhance user experience but are supplementary to core functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by opening search interfaces and verifying they match the mockup design with proper styling and layout.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a file is open, **When** a user activates in-page search, **Then** the search bar appears with proper styling and controls
2. **Given** the application is running, **When** a user opens global search, **Then** the search panel displays with the enhanced design and layout
3. **Given** search is active, **When** a user interacts with search controls, **Then** buttons and indicators have proper visual feedback

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the application is resized to very small dimensions while maintaining visual clarity?
- How does the interface handle extremely long file names or paths in tabs and sidebar?
- What occurs when switching themes while modal dialogs or search panels are open?
- How does the interface respond when many tabs are open and the user rapidly switches between them?
