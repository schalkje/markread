# Implementation Plan: Mockup UI Implementation

**Branch**: `003-mockup-ui` | **Date**: October 28, 2025 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/003-mockup-ui/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implement a modern, professional UI design for the MarkRead markdown viewer that matches the provided Figma mockup. This involves enhancing the existing WPF application with updated visual styling, improved component layouts, responsive design principles, and comprehensive light/dark theme support. The primary technical approach focuses on CSS/styling updates within the WebView2 component and XAML refinements for native WPF controls, while preserving all existing functionality and performance characteristics.

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: C# .NET 8  
**Primary Dependencies**: WPF, WebView2, Markdig (for markdown processing)  
**Storage**: Local application settings file (JSON/XML) for theme preferences and UI state  
**Testing**: Integration tests for UI behavior, unit tests for theme/settings logic  
**Target Platform**: Windows desktop application (Windows 10+)  
**Project Type**: Desktop WPF application with WebView2 integration  
**Performance Goals**: <100ms theme switching, 60fps animations, <10% startup time increase  
**Constraints**: Maintain existing functionality, preserve WebView2 compatibility  
**Scale/Scope**: Single-user desktop application, enhanced UI for existing features

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### I. Code Quality
✅ **PASS** - UI enhancement maintains code maintainability through modular CSS/XAML styling with clear separation of concerns

### II. User Experience Consistency  
✅ **PASS** - Mockup-based design ensures consistent UI patterns, terminology, and behavior throughout the application

### III. Documentation Standard
✅ **PASS** - Plan includes clear documentation of design decisions, styling approaches, and visual specifications

### IV. Performance Requirements
✅ **PASS** - Specified performance targets (<100ms theme switching, 60fps animations, <10% startup impact) meet desktop application standards

**Post-Phase 1 Re-evaluation**:
✅ **Code Quality**: Modular service interfaces maintain clean separation between theme, UI state, and animation concerns  
✅ **User Experience**: API contracts ensure consistent behavior across all UI components with proper error handling  
✅ **Documentation**: Comprehensive contracts, data models, and quickstart guide provide clear implementation guidance  
✅ **Performance**: Animation service includes automatic complexity reduction for resource-intensive operations  

**Overall**: ✅ All constitution gates pass - ready for Phase 2 task implementation

| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
