# Tasks: Folder Structure Treeview

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-folder-treeview/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/commands.md, quickstart.md

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure for treeview feature

- [X] T001 Review existing WPF application structure in src/App/ and src/UI/ to understand integration points
- [X] T002 Verify .NET 8 SDK and WPF dependencies are properly configured in src/App/MarkRead.App.csproj
- [X] T003 [P] Create UI/Sidebar/TreeView/ directory structure for new treeview components

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core data models and services that ALL user stories depend on

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [X] T004 Create TreeNode model class in src/Services/TreeNode.cs with properties (Name, FullPath, Type, Parent, Children, IsExpanded, IsSelected, IsVisible) and INotifyPropertyChanged implementation
- [X] T005 Create NodeType enum in src/Services/TreeNode.cs with values Folder and File
- [X] T006 [P] Create TreeViewSettings model in src/Services/TreeViewSettings.cs with DefaultVisible and PerFolderSettings dictionary
- [X] T007 [P] Create FolderTreeSettings model in src/Services/TreeViewSettings.cs with IsVisible and LastViewedFile properties
- [X] T008 Create TreeViewService class in src/Services/TreeViewService.cs with skeleton methods (BuildTreeAsync, DetermineInitialFileAsync, SaveVisibilityPreference)
- [X] T009 Add TreeViewService registration to dependency injection container in src/App/App.xaml.cs

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - View Markdown Content Immediately (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1, 2, AND 3 should all work independently - treeview can be toggled and state persists

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Set Default Treeview Preference (Priority: P4)

**Goal**: Provide global default preference for treeview visibility in new folders

**Independent Test**: Change default preference, open new folder, verify treeview visibility matches preference

### Implementation for User Story 4

- [ ] T059 [P] [US4] Add integration test in tests/integration/TreeViewIntegrationTests.cs to verify global preference applies to new folders and individual settings override

**Checkpoint**: All user stories 1-4 should now be independently functional

---

## Phase 7: User Story 5 - Keyboard Navigation (Priority: P3)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1 (Phase 3) can start immediately after Foundational
  - US2 (Phase 4) can start in parallel with US1 (different commands/features)
  - US3 (Phase 5) can start in parallel with US1/US2 (different feature - visibility toggle)
  - US4 (Phase 6) depends on US3 (extends visibility settings)
  - US5 (Phase 7) can start in parallel with US1-US4 (different feature - keyboard navigation)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories - **MVP SCOPE**
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent (navigation builds on US1 tree but separate feature)
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent (visibility toggle separate from navigation)
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Depends on US3 (extends visibility settings with global default)
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent (keyboard navigation works with any tree state)

### Within Each User Story

- Phase 2 Foundational tasks must complete before ANY user story tasks
- Tests marked [P] can run in parallel (different test files)
- Implementation tasks within a story generally sequential (models ‚Üí services ‚Üí viewmodels ‚Üí views)
- Unit tests can be written in parallel with integration tests (different files)

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: All tasks can run sequentially (only 3 quick tasks)
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: T006 and T007 can run in parallel (both model creation)
- **User Story 1**: T021, T022, T023, T024 (all tests) can run in parallel after implementation complete
- **User Story 2**: T037, T038, T039, T040 (all tests) can run in parallel after implementation complete
- **User Story 3**: T051, T052, T053 (all tests) can run in parallel after implementation complete
- **User Story 4**: T058, T059 (tests) can run in parallel
- **User Story 5**: T060 and T061 (NavigateUp/Down commands) can run in parallel; T077, T078, T079, T080 (tests) can run in parallel
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: T081, T082, T087, T089, T090, T091 can run in parallel (different files/concerns)
- **Cross-Phase Parallelism**: After Foundational, US1, US2, US3, and US5 can all start in parallel by different developers

---

## Parallel Example: After Foundational Phase Complete

```bash
# Multiple developers can work in parallel:
Developer A: Implement User Story 1 (Phase 3) - Async tree building and initial display
Developer B: Implement User Story 2 (Phase 4) - Tree navigation and file watching  
Developer C: Implement User Story 3 (Phase 5) - Visibility toggle and settings
Developer D: Implement User Story 5 (Phase 7) - Keyboard navigation and type-ahead

# All four stories are independent and can be tested separately
# US4 can start once US3 completes (extends same feature)
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T003)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T004-T009) - CRITICAL BLOCKER
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T010-T024) - Immediate markdown display with async tree loading
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test US1 independently - verify SC-001 (< 1s initial display) and SC-002 (< 5s tree load)
5. Deploy/demo MVP if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational (Phases 1-2)
2. Add User Story 1 (Phase 3) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí **MVP READY** - Deploy/Demo
3. Add User Story 2 (Phase 4) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (navigation + file watching)
4. Add User Story 3 (Phase 5) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (visibility toggle)
5. Add User Story 4 (Phase 6) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (global preference)
6. Add User Story 5 (Phase 7) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (keyboard navigation)
7. Polish (Phase 8) ‚Üí Final validation ‚Üí Production release

### Parallel Team Strategy

With 3-4 developers after Foundational phase completes:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (Phases 1-2)
2. Once Phase 2 done, split work:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (T010-T024) - Core tree functionality
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (T025-T040) - Navigation and file watching
   - Developer C: User Story 3 + 4 (T041-T059) - Settings and preferences
   - Developer D: User Story 5 (T060-T080) - Keyboard navigation
3. Each developer completes their story independently with tests
4. Team integrates and completes Phase 8 Polish together

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability (US1, US2, US3, US4, US5)
- Each user story is independently completable and testable
- **MVP = User Story 1 only** (immediate markdown display with async tree loading)
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently before proceeding
- All performance targets defined in success criteria (SC-001 through SC-011) must be validated with tests
- FileSystemWatcher configuration critical: filter markdown only, debounce 500ms, <2% CPU
- Type-ahead search uses 300ms debounce for optimal UX (FR-021, SC-010)
- Tree virtualization required for large folders (1000+ files)
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
