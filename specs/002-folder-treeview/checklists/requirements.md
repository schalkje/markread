# Specification Quality Checklist: Folder Structure Treeview

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 28, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All quality checks passed

### Details

**Content Quality**: All sections focus on what users need and why, without mentioning specific technologies like WPF, WebView2, or file system APIs. Content is accessible to non-technical stakeholders.

**Requirement Completeness**:

- All 13 functional requirements are clear and testable
- No clarification markers needed - all requirements have sensible defaults
- Edge cases comprehensively cover boundary conditions (empty folders, deep hierarchies, permissions, large datasets, file system changes, symbolic links)
- Success criteria include specific metrics (1 second load time, 5 second scan time, 500ms navigation, 100ms toggle response)

**Feature Readiness**:

- 4 user stories prioritized by value (P1-P4), each independently testable
- Acceptance scenarios defined using Given-When-Then format
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- Scope is well-bounded (markdown files only, folder navigation, visibility persistence)

## Assumptions Made

- Markdown file extensions include .md and .markdown (standard extensions)
- "Lazy loading" means background asynchronous loading after initial display
- Treeview shows folder hierarchy with files nested under folders
- Toggle control will be easily discoverable in the UI
- Settings persistence uses standard application settings storage (not specified as implementation detail)
- File system watching for real-time updates is not required (noted in edge cases)
- Performance targets assume modern desktop hardware

## Notes

Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan` phase.
